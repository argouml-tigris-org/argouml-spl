</p>

<p>
Building the application by their own way, the users may obtain a version of ArgoUML that will contain only what really wants, without the necessity to obtain a package with various functionalities which will not be used, which leads the economy of space for installation, less traffic to the distribution of installation and smaller consumption of memory and processing obtained with no need of loading  subsystems which would not be used.
